I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/), advised by [Prof. Nak Young Chong](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/robot/index.php). My research focuses on **adaptive visual SLAM** for robust robot localization across diverse and challenging environments.

## Research Interests

Many SLAM algorithms rely on fixed parameters and assumptions, performing well in controlled settings but degrading significantly in challenging conditions such as low-light, low-texture, occluded, or dynamic environments. My research addresses this gap by developing **adaptive SLAM systems** that assess environmental conditions and self-adjust accordingly. I explore both heuristic and learning-based approaches to enable algorithms to adapt across environments without manual tuning, aiming to build SLAM systems that operate robustly in diverse real-world conditions.
